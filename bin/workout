workout
~~~~~~~

A little script that helps you stay fit.

Place a file called ``.workoutrc`` in your HOME directory, with ini-style
configuration format. Each sections represents an exercise type, and the
``current`` option specifies how many repetitions you are able to do.

Here's an example if you do push-ups and squats:

    [push-ups]
    current = 10

    [squats]
    current = 20

for exercise in config.sections():
    exercises[exercise] = {
        CURRENT: config.getint(exercise, CURRENT),
    }

    deviation = int(mean / 10)
    repetitions[ex] = [int(normalvariate(mean, deviation)) for _ in xrange(5)]
